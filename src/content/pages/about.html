            <p class="cs-text">
                Mai's Massage Therapy brings authentic Thai healing traditions to the heart of Whitstable. Founded by Mai, who originates from Surin in Thailand, our practice combines time-honored techniques with modern therapeutic approaches. Since moving to the UK in 2014, Mai has dedicated herself to mastering the art of Thai massage, working professionally for over two years, including a year at Sunshine Thai Massage and Spa before establishing her own practice.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Our mission extends beyond simple relaxation. We strive to make massage therapy an integral part of our clients' health and wellness journey, providing therapeutic treatments that make a meaningful difference through evidence-based techniques and traditional Thai healing practices. Each session begins with a thorough assessment to understand your specific needs, allowing us to create truly personalized treatment plans that address your unique concerns and wellness goals.
